# Image Analyser Project, "Mapp" by Derick Su

## Project Description
**Mapp** analyses the sizes of contigouous "clumps" of colour (henceforth referred to as "clumps") in the provided images. Using commands, the user can then gather data of the clumps using commands.

# Commands
**Commands** are what the user types in the *Enter Command:* field. Commands are used to obtain the data which is collected by the program. There are two types of **Commands**, **Global Commands** which are commands used to anaylse clumps from all images and compare them, and **Single Image Commands** which only analyse clumps within one image.

## Global Commands
### ALLIMG
Returns a list with all images which has been inputted into the program.
### TOP
Returns an ordered list, from largest to smallest, of the top 5 largest clumps in the database.
### LARGE
Returns an ordered list, from largest to smallest, of the largest clump of each image.
### ONEIMG
Begins the single image command interface.
